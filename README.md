## Hatman-UnityGame
Simple game made with Unity 2017.3.0f3.

Purpouse of this project was to learn game development with Unity. 
I made everything by myself, 3D models (Blender), animations for player and skeleton (Blender), animations for UI (Unity), level design, scripts (used MonoDevelop).

My goal is to be game programmer, but in this project I had chance to try many aspects of game dev.

Game is **not finished**, I work on more features.

Hatman's **ToDo** list:

~~Scratched things are ready~~

- ~~Change camera to be third person~~
- ~~Stamina~~
- Pickups such as heal packs or gun upgrades (interaction with house to open upgrades maybe)
	There will be timer, measuring enemies wave duration. After this time, player will have opportunity to buy some health, upgrades in the house. At this time, only interaction detection works, next step is to think through upgrades and costs (score points as money). Then I will create upgrade menu.
- Gun upgrades
- Different enemy types
- Minimap
- ~~Start menu and game over screen~~
- ~~Headshots~~
- ~~Adjust in skeleton attack trigger (now they can attack when player is behind them)~~
- Adjust player and enemy speed, spawn rate
- Difficulty levels
- ~~Floating gunpoint~~
- ~~Enemies get stuck in obstacles~~
- ~~Skybox~~
- ~~Rework Game - UI communication~~ [used this](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/CSharpMessenger_Extended)
- **After game starts, first mouse move makes strange jump, but only once. It's not harmful, but ugly**
