## Hatman-UnityGame
Simple game made with Unity.

Purpouse of this project was to learn game development with Unity. 
I made everything by myself, 3D models, animations, level design, scripts.

My goal is to be game programmer, but in this project I had chance to try many aspects of game dev.

Game is **not finished**, i will add more features, a little summary of what I have done:

- ~~Change camera to be third person~~
- ~~Stamina~~
- Pickups such as heal packs or gun upgrades (interaction with house to open ypgrades maybe)
- Gun upgrades
- Different enemy types
- Minimap
- ~~Start menu and game over screen~~
- ~~Headshots~~
- ~~Adjust in skeleton attack trigger (now they can attack when player is behind them)~~
- Adjust player and enemy speed, spawn rate
- Difficulty levels
- ~~Floating gunpoint~~
- ~~Enemies get stuck in obstacles~~
- ~~Skybox~~
- ~~Rework Game - UI communication~~ [used this](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/CSharpMessenger_Extended)
- **After game starts, first mouse move makes strange jump, but only once. It's not harmful, but ugly**
