## Hatman-UnityGame
Simple game made with Unity.

Purpouse of this project was to learn game development with Unity. 
I made everything by myself, 3D models, animations, level design, scripts.

My goal is to be game programmer, but in this project I had chance to try many aspects of game dev.

Game is **not finished**, next I'll work on:

- Change camera to be third person
- Add stamina
- Add pickups such as heal packs or gun upgrades
- Gun upgrades
- Different enemy types
- Minimap
- Start menu and game over screen
